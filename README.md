Fusion is an open-source lightweight user behaviour analytics and engagement pltaform.

Its built upon a simplified low-code mixpanel like analytics engine with built-in live-chat, push-notification and email/micro-surveys.

Fusion shows how your users interact with your web based products eg: page-views, button clicks, form submissions etc. But apart from this, Fusion lets you engage with a specific user or group of user who have something in common or performed a particular action, in real-time with live-chat, in-app push notification, email/micro-surveys or set it up to trigger automatically.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Story

After getting rejected in Y Combinator-W21 interview and scrapping our previous project we started to work on a simplfied open-source alternative to mixpanel/amplitude for startups as these platforms were bit bloated and we could only find session based simplified analytics alternatives like plausible & simple analytics.

We quickly realised that our early customers who were also startups did not wanted to use another SAAS platform because they were already dealing with things like intercom, mailchimp, google-analytics etc. These tools have too many features as they are seperate stand-alone platforms small teams endup spending lot of time and money. On the other hand integration between all these platforms is crappy and third party customer data platforms like segment are expensive and overkill. We personally use & love crisp.chat not just because how simple it is but also how it focuses on important features only and still gives an unified experience.

Inspired with all these, we decided to build a lightweight all-in-one solution helping startups understand, engage, convert and retain users from single app.
